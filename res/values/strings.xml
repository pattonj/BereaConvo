    <string name="help_info">        &lt;b>Viewing Convos&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        To view a certain convocation simply click on the title of the convo.This will either open it in a new window or in the display panel.  
       &lt;br> &lt;br>&lt;b>Sorting Convos&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        To toggle between Fall and Spring convocations, click the button in the top right corner. 
        If you would like to sort the convocations by time, either slide your finger to the right, or click the top left button to show the menu. 
        &lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>Attendance&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        To mark a convocation as attended, long press on the list title until a green arrow appears. This does NOT mark it as attended in the Berea College database. It is simply a way to help you keep track of how many you have attended. You still are required to turn in your convocation card.</string>
