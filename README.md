BereaConvo
==========

An application for viewing information about Berea College convocations. 

Instructions
 
 Viewing Convos
 	To view a certain convocation simply click on the title of the convo.This will either open it in a new window or in the display panel.  
 
 Sorting Convos
	To toggle between Fall and Spring convocations, click the button in the top right corner. 
    If you would like to sort the convocations by time, either slide your finger to the right, or click the top left button to show the menu. 
    
Attendance
	To mark a convocation as attended, long press on the list title until a green arrow appears. This does NOT mark it as attended in the Berea College database. It is simply a way to help you keep track of how many you have attended. You still are required to turn in your convocation card.



Berea Convo uses the ActionBarSherlock and SlidingMenu Libraries

      - After installing either clean the projects or restart eclipse if it is still not working. 
      
Also, make sure that both libraries are included in your project and open in eclipse.
